# co2Estimator
A project started keeping in mind to make a PyPI package for co2 emission estimation.

# Estimator and Estimation
The estimator uses the data provided by [US EPA](https://www.epa.gov/greenvehicles/greenhouse-gas-emissions-typical-passenger-vehicle) and predict the co2 emitted by the vehicle based on vehicle-type(petrol or diesel) and distance travelled.

# How to use
Well it's pretty easy:
1. pip install co2Estimator
2. import co2Estimator
3. co2Estimator.co2Emitted('petrol',25,1)
and we are done!!!

# Support and Feedback
I am open to ideas or any suggestions.
